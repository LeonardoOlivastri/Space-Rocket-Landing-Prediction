# IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-SpaceX

The commercial space age is here: companies are making space travel affordable for everyone, and Perhaps the most successful is SpaceX. SpaceX’s accomplishments include: 
Sending spacecraft to the International Space Station
Starlink, a satellite internet constellation providing satellite Internet access 
Sending manned missions to Space. 
One reason SpaceX can do this is that the rocket launches are relatively inexpensive: SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars. Other providers cost upwards of 165 million dollars each.
Much of the savings is because SpaceX can sometimes reuse the first stage: therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. In fact, sometimes the first stage does not land: sometimes it will crash and other times, Space X will sacrifice the first stage due to the mission parameters like payload, orbit, and customer. 
Space Y would like to compete with SpaceX. 

The problem is to determine the price of each launch. 
We did this by gathering information about Space X and creating dashboards for the team. The main problem is to determine if SpaceX will reuse the first stage. Instead of using rocket science to determine if the first stage will land successfully, we’ll train a machine learning model and use public information to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.
